# Patching_DL

This repository contains the codes and the instructions for the implementation using Tensorflow v.2.2.0 of a deep learning model for the 3D image inpainting. It has been specifically designed for 3D Bragg X-ray diffraction patterns affected by detectors gaps. 

The structure of the repository is the following: 

**- data:** BCDI files 
**-models:** saved models for the inpainting of gaps with size of 3, 6, 9, 12 pixels 
**notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for the handling of the model, the plotting of figures and assessment of model performances 


I developped the codes during my PhD at the University Grenoble - Alpes, in collaboration with the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the ENGAGE programme, partially funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement number 101034267.
